Model Performance Explanation:
- Accuracy (0.964): Percentage of correct predictions
- Precision (0.95): When predicting sepsis, how often we're correct
- Recall (0.934): What percentage of actual sepsis cases we detected
- F1 Score (0.942): Balance between precision and recall
- ROC AUC (0.99): Model's ability to distinguish classes (1=perfect)
